### ðŸ‘‹ Tomâ€™s GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, my name is Tom Hudson. I started programming at a very young age, learning Atari BASIC on an [Atari XEGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_XEGS). I then moved into BASIC on an Apple IIe, then onto Pascal and dBase all while in middle school and high school. Professionally, my experience in programming was fat-client or n-tier architecture, often utilizing Oracle or SQL Server backends, VB, ASP, and some C#.


I currently live in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and provide IT & Quality [consulting services](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hudsonthomas/) in the medical device sector. I also teach meditation, [yoga, and am an mindful outdoor guide](https://tom-hudson.com).

After a 15+ years programming hiatus, Iâ€™m delving back into code and currently learning the following:

- HTML / CSS / Bootstrap / JavaScript
- MERN Stack
- MongoDB = document database
- Express(js) = web framework
- React(js) = client-side JavaScript framework
- Node(js) = JavaScript web server
